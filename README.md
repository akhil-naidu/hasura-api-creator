# Hasura API Creator

Hasura API creator is a simple admin panel to create APIs using Hasura as the GraphQL engine.

# What are the use cases

The primary use case of this is to provide an admin panel with role-based access to populate the data to the PostgreSQL database.

This way non developer employees can participate in populating the database.

# What about generating the schema

The schema is to be generated in the Hasura GraphQL Console. Once the schema is generated based on the schema we will get UI to populate the database

# What about the database

We will be using the PostgreSQL database in the background
